        <p>
          We at Compose :: Melbourne are delighted to call for presentations for our 2018 conference!
        </p>
        <p>
          Compose :: Melbourne is a functional programming conference focused on
          developing the community and bringing functional programming to a wider
          audience. It is a 2-day event being held in Melbourne, Australia on the
          27th and 28th of August 2018. The first day features a single track of
          presentations followed by a second day of workshops and an unconference.
          We are a sister-conference of the NY based Compose :: Conference.

          Provide sufficient detail in your submission to enable the reviewers
          to understand your proposal and clearly identify what an attendee
          will gain from attending your session. You should include the
          following information in the submission system:

        <ul>
          <li> Authors - The details of each of the presenters </li>
          <li> Title - Title of the presentation (please keep it brief and specific) </li>
          <li>
            Abstract	- A 300-500 word description of your presentation, ideally including...
            <ul>
              <li> Description of the content</li>
              <li> Goal </li>

          <li>
            Keywords - List any keywords that will help the program committee
            and attendees categorise your presentation. Also indicate the
            functional programming languages that you will be targeting.

        </ul>
        <p> You are not required to have a paper accompanying your presentation. </p>

          Nothing upsets an audience more than a speaker that stands on stage blatantly
          promoting his or her company, product or achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please keep the content of your talk on-topic and do not use this speaking
          opportunity as a sales pitch.

          All topics for proposals for presentations are invited, but not limited to
          explore the following topics:
        </p>
        <h3> New Languages </h3>
        <p>
          The development of new and emerging Functional Languages, and the toolsets
          around them.
        </p>
        <h3> Libraries and Tools </h3>
        <p>
          Exploring the use and development of new and underrepresented tools and
          libraries.
        </p>
        <h3> Production Systems </h3>
        <p>
          2018 continues the trend of many previously under-deployed languages
          and systems break through into production. We're looking for
          war-stories, success-stories and sob-stories!
        </p>
        <h3> Theory </h3>
        <p>
          Theory is the cutting edge of new functional programming. Show the world
          what is rising over the horizon.
        </p>
        <h3> Art and Music </h3>
        <p> Exciting and innovative usage of functional programming language in the arts! </p>

        <p> The second day will be dedicated to workshops and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconferences</a>. </p>
        <h3> Workshops </h3>
        <p>
          If you wish to run a workshop on the second day of the conference, then
          please <a href="https://compose-cfparty-2018.herokuapp.com/workshops/new">propose your workshop</a>.
          Alternatively, if there is a workshop that would interest
          you as an attendee, then please also let us know.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note: Workshop organisers will be given a free ticket.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3> Unconference </h3>
        <p>
          Got something random you want to talk about? The unconference will run
          the second day. There will be a whiteboard with spaces where anyone
          can write their name down to speak. There's no need to bring anything
          but yourself and your ideas and speaking voice.
