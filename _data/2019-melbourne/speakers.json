      "abstract":
        "Property-based testing is a popular testing concept, which came from the world of Functional Programming. QuickCheck in Haskell is an iconic framework, which introduced us to this idea. Today we can find testing libraries supporting PBT in any main-stream languages, including Scala, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, etc. <br /><br /> We all like the idea of building high quality and robust code, covering all the possible and impossible edge cases. Maybe this is why many of us are getting hooked on the Property-based testing approach or at least we are not opposed to try it out.<br /><br /> It gives us an ability to run a single test case hundreds of times on a large range of data, covering edge cases we’ve never thought we had in the first place.<br /><br /> However, if you are like me and your day-to-day job is to create an API and save data into a database or maybe even send it over to another API, you also probably struggled to come up with a good application of this practice. It is easy and “very useful” to test that a reverse of a collection is still working. But, when it comes to if-else conditions, we find it hard to come up with the right property to test. <br /><br /> In this talk I would like to focus on a practical application of this concept, presenting some examples in ScalaCheck. I will start with a summary of what Property-based testing (PBT) framework equips you with and what should you expect from it. There will be basic examples demonstrating the power of PBT. But mostly, I will cover existing patterns and tips you can take to your normal life projects and use them to leverage this PBT tool.",

      "abstract":
        "Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is often introduced by discussing events and behaviors, and how to transform and mix them. But once you understand the primitives, what do you do with them? Where do the first events come from, and how do you wire these parts into a larger whole? <br /><br />FRP promises benefits in more domains than just user interfaces, so let's take a look at Reflex outside its most common habitat of web frontends. There's now a fairly up-to-date version of Reflex on Hackage, so we can play with it right away and leave GHCjs, Reflex-DOM, special build tools, and the custom nix frameworks for later. <br /><br />An FRP network of events and behaviors runs inside a library called a \"host\", which interfaces between the FRP network and the outside world. Using an interactive OpenGL program as our example, we'll explore how a slightly larger reactive program hangs together, and how it uses the host's features to do what it needs to do.",

Efficient implementation will not be covered. <br /><br />The Haskell community has recently seen concurrency abstractions bearing similarities to propagators, such as the work on LVars by Kuper and Newton; and also projects directly influenced by propagators, such as Edward Kmett's recent work.",

This workshop will give you hands-on experience with these libraries. <p/> The workshop will show attendees a new way to manage state and time-dependent logic, with significant benefits over the standard approaches when it comes to abstraction, composition and correctness. It will also make the case that when these ideas are applied to front-end development, they lead to something beyond what is delivered by libraries like `react` and `redux`.",
